Plotting with Geoplot and GeoPandas
-----------------------------------

`Geoplot <https://residentmario.github.io/geoplot/index.html>`_ is a Python
library providing a selection of easy-to-use geospatial visualizations. It is
built on top of the lower-level `CartoPy <http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/>`_,
covered in a separate section of this tutorial, and is designed to work with
GeoPandas input.

This example is a brief tour of the `geoplot` API. For more details on the
library refer to `its documentation
<https://residentmario.github.io/geoplot/index.html>`_.

First we'll load in the data using GeoPandas.



.. code-block:: python

    import geopandas

    path = geopandas.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres')
    df = geopandas.read_file(path)
    # Add a column we'll use later
    df['gdp_pp'] = df['gdp_md_est'] / df['pop_est']

    boroughs = geopandas.read_file(geopandas.datasets.get_path('nybb')).to_crs(epsg='4326')
    injurious_collisions = geopandas.read_file(
        "https://github.com/ResidentMario/geoplot-data/raw/master/nyc-injurious-collisions.geojson")








Plotting with Geoplot
=====================

We start out by replicating the basic GeoPandas world plot using Geoplot.



.. code-block:: python

    import geoplot

    geoplot.polyplot(df, figsize=(8, 4))




.. image:: /gallery/images/sphx_glr_plotting_with_geoplot_001.png
    :align: center




Geoplot can re-project data into any of the map projections provided by
CartoPy (see the list
`here <http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/crs/projections.html>`_).



.. code-block:: python


    import geoplot.crs as gcrs
    ax = geoplot.polyplot(df, projection=gcrs.Orthographic(), figsize=(8, 4))
    ax.set_global()
    ax.outline_patch.set_visible(True)




.. image:: /gallery/images/sphx_glr_plotting_with_geoplot_002.png
    :align: center




``polyplot`` is trivial and can only plot the geometries you pass to it. If
you want to use color as a visual variable, specify a ``choropleth``. Here
we sort GDP per person by country into five buckets by color.



.. code-block:: python


    geoplot.choropleth(df, hue='gdp_pp', cmap='Greens', figsize=(8, 4))




.. image:: /gallery/images/sphx_glr_plotting_with_geoplot_003.png
    :align: center




If you want to use size as a visual variable, you want a ``cartogram``. Here
are population estimates for countries in Africa.



.. code-block:: python


    geoplot.cartogram(df[df['continent'] == 'Africa'],
                      scale='pop_est', limits=(0.2, 1), figsize=(7, 8))




.. image:: /gallery/images/sphx_glr_plotting_with_geoplot_004.png
    :align: center




If we have data in the shape of points in space, we may generate a
three-dimensional heatmap on it using ``kdeplot``. This example also
demonstrates how easy it is to stack plots on top of one another.



.. code-block:: python


    ax = geoplot.kdeplot(injurious_collisions.sample(1000),
                         shade=True, shade_lowest=False,
                         clip=boroughs.geometry)
    geoplot.polyplot(boroughs, ax=ax)




.. image:: /gallery/images/sphx_glr_plotting_with_geoplot_005.png
    :align: center




Alternatively, we may partition the space into neighborhoods automatically,
using Voronoi tessellation.



.. code-block:: python


    ax = geoplot.voronoi(
        injurious_collisions.sample(1000),
        hue='NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED', cmap='Reds', scheme='fisher_jenks',
        clip=boroughs.geometry,
        linewidth=0)
    geoplot.polyplot(boroughs, ax=ax)




.. image:: /gallery/images/sphx_glr_plotting_with_geoplot_006.png
    :align: center




Again, these are just some of the plots you can make with Geoplot. There are
several other possibilities not covered in this brief introduction. For more
examples, refer to the
`Gallery <https://residentmario.github.io/geoplot/gallery.html>`_ in the
Geoplot documentation.
